### Remove these once completed
- Column1 has all the following points PLUS all the  points from the
  [Software Sustainability Evaluation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0ccsVdN-nXJCHLluJ-hANZlp8rDKgprJa0oTYiLZSDxh3DA/viewform).
- Column2  is your self-assessment. For each items, score yourself zero (none), one  (a litte),  two (somewhat), three (a lot).
- Column3 is for any links you  are adding to support your claim in column two.
- At the top,  show the sum of column2,

|workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... 
but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)| GF: 2,  |evidence  in GH|
| Number of commits| GF: 3, | in GH |
| Number of commits: by different people| GF: 3, | in GH|
| Issues reports: there are **many**| GF: 1, | in GH|

| DOI badge: exists | GF: 2, |in GH|
| Docs: doco generated , format not ugly| GF: 2, |in GH|
| Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) | GF: 1, | |
| Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z| GF: 0, |doc page entries|
| Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| GF: 0, | |
| Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.| GF: 0, | |
| Use of version control tools| GF: 3, | |
| Use of  style checkers | GF: 1, | config files in GH showing your config|
| Use of code formatters. | GF: 2, | config files in GH showing your this formatter's  config|
| Use of syntax checkers. | GF: 2, | config files iin  GH showing this checker's config  |
| Use of code coverage | GF: 1, | config files in GH |
| other automated analysis tools | GF: 2|config files in GH|
| test cases exist | GF: 0, |dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the  code base|
| test cases are routinely executed | GF: 0, |e.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something|
| the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up| | |
| issues are discussed before they are closed | GF: 3, | even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here|
| Chat channel: exists| GF: 3, | Screenshot of Telegram in experiments folder|
| test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.| GF: 0, |if a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files | GF: 3, | |
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| GF: 1, | |
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| GF: 2, | |
| evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base| GF: 3, | |
| short release cycles | GF: 3, | (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|
